While the past has seen higher inflation connecting dots to major growth trends, the Fed seems to have taken a great risk by enacting extreme measures by raising the interest rates to push the economic growth post-pandemic.

It has made an agreement with Fox Corporation which gives Fox the right to acquire an 18.6% stake in the company. This option will be valid from June 2021. The division located in the US includes different brands like FanDuel, FOX Bet, TVG, PokerStars, and Betfair. This division is diverse in its operations in a way that it offers betting, both in retail and online, and caters to the betting of sports, online gaming, poker, television broadcasting as well as advance deposit betting on horse racing. It has established a name in its domain as a market leader. FanDuel was founded in 2009 and has been growing exponentially, due to which it has now become the largest online sports betting company claiming 40% of the market share.

The company however clarified that no decision has yet been made but whenever that happens, it will be formally announced. Even this declaration benefited the company as its shares went up by 6%.

This exclusion of Flutter from FanDuel is done in order to address this issue of undervaluation. According to the company, its revenues were higher than that of DraftKings, valued at $644 million, while Flutter was valued at $896 million. DraftKings entered the market in April 2020 through a merger with SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) in 2019, which was the closest rival to FanDuel. This merger was done at $10 per share. Flutter’s shareholders were not happy with the stock market as it failed to assess this strong market position. What’s interesting is that the announcement led to an increased share price of Flutter which was valued at 27.7 billion pounds ($38.5 billion). Separating Flutter from FanDuel will be useful to the shareholders as it will unlock its value and will provide an opportunity to the investors to finance in a market-leading US sports betting company. This will help diminish the adverse regulatory risk of flutter shares. As the States strive towards making online betting legal, the industry for online betting is also increasing.

EURJPY is expected to cross the 130 region any day now and if that happens, a new high of 132 can be expected soon enough. The pair will see strong resistance around this level but breaking it would mean a new record high price that has never been seen before.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Interestingly, EURJPY has been trading above the support level, 127.50, that was naturally created back in November 2020.

For the coming week, certain EURJPY levels would be very important to note for investors who are looking to invest short-term and long term. Right now the pair has gained about 0.22% around the 130 mark and is continuing to rise. Here are the levels to be noted next week:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>1. A strong hurdle is expected at 130.50 which would help the bears take control of the situation to some extent but good news for the bulls, it won\'t last long and the pair is definitely expected to cross this mark.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2. The next important level would be 131 but this has to do with the psychological factors. When EURJPY touches 131, the cognitive abilities of many investors would push them to sell the pair creating an illusion that it might be overbought. Of course, that won\'t last long either.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. If EURJPY crosses the first 2 levels, the 3rd level would be the high of 2018 around 131.98. Here things would get interesting. A strong resistance is expected at 131.98 but if EURJPY crosses this point, there\'s not stopping it then!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Our verdict:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While EURJPY is on a bullish journey this week, the scenario might take a 180 degrees turn and go in favour of the bears for a short time period but that won\'t be easy. Currently, favouring a bearish trend for EURJPY would be quite unrealistic. The pair is set to cross 140 and it might even make a new world record.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The only important aspect to be noticed here is the fluctuation that would occur during the next few weeks.

The rise of a dispute with ex-US president, Donald Trump, ignited a recession and put Lira in a state of crisis back in 2018. Turkey has been having an unstable foreign relation with the United States of America and Istanbul’s assets are heavily reliant on Washington. As a basic mathematical equation would suggest, Istanbul is having unstable economic conditions since. Biden fulfilled his campaign promise to Armenian-Americans and recognized the killings of millions of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as genocide. This has not only strained already strained relations with Turkey but also catapulted Istanbul towards Moscow. Turkey criticized that the move has “undermined trust and friendship”. Ibrahim Kalin also expressed frustration to Reuters News Agency that Washington is behaving irresponsibly and recognition of Armenia’s genocide means Biden is trying to, “artificially undermine ongoing relationships for narrow political agendas.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>What about the Turkish Lira and Assets?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In emerging markets of 2021, the Turkish Lira has been performing the worst so far. Monday saw it come close to its record low in the market when it touched 8.425 against the US dollar. Turkish Lira was at its lowest last November when it recorded 8.58 versus the US dollar. After Biden’s official recognition of the Armenian genocide on Saturday, Lira lost 3.5 percent in the last three trading days. The reason behind this dip is not only the strained relation with Washington. Recep Tayyip Erdogan appointed a new central bank chief, Sahap Kavcioglu, a month ago. Kavcioglu announced higher interest rates would hurt the economy and he would keep the monetary policy constricted… for now.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Erdogan appointed Kavcioglu after sacking a respected policy watchman, Naci Agbal. This move plunged Lira as low as 15%. Kavcioglu is as conservative as Erdogan when it comes to policymaking and both believe that higher interest rates should be avoided. However, Agbal had designed a monetary policy where the interest rate was raised to 19% to curtail inflation when it was at 16%. Experts and analysts predict inflation to go as high as a whopping 18% since Kavcioglu would follow an orthodox policy of selling foreign reserves to keep the inflation rate under control. Foreign investors are not happy with Erdogan’s decision of changing central bank governors. They sold their Turkish assets when Agbal was sacked.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 2019 and 2020, Turkey witnessed a sharp decline in its foreign reserves which accounted for at least 128 billion dollars. The opposition has brought this rapid depletion into question and has asked for an explanation since it was backed by the central bank. The New Central Bank’s chief has defended this move by saying that the Turkish Lira would have depreciated to record lows if foreign reserves were not sold as rapidly as they did. He related to bad examples of 20 years ago when corporate went bankrupt since Lira could not be engineered to rise and compete in the international market; “You need to meet the FX demand of last year, if you don’t, Turkey would have to face the consequences.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'Turkish Lira Reaches Lowest Watermark Of 2021', NULL, 'Published', NULL, 'Uncategorized', '1623069939_omid-armin-DVi5c4Tr4cA-unsplash.jpg', NULL, '2021-06-07 07:45:39'),

China was the only country with the largest growing economy in 2020. The United States was hit hard by the pandemic and lagged behind, but 2021 saw a positive change as it lifted restrictions and rolled out vaccines at a steady pace. Figures released this Thursday showed that the US economy grew by 1.6 percent in the first quarter of this year. Fiscal support in the shape of a relief package of 1.9 trillion US dollars along with earlier support packages helped US citizens’ large majority to stay above the poverty line. Another evidence of US economic recovery is the latest unemployment rate falling to 6.0 percent after peaking to a high 14.8 percent during the worst conditions brought by the pandemic.

However, 11 states have imposed some form of lockdowns, including the northern state of Haryana and the eastern state of Odisha, both of which happen to be important industrial states of India.

It was absolutely imperative for the Starship prototype to make a successful landing this time because Space X was lucky in securing funding from NASA in the shape of a contract with a promise to complete their Artemis moon program which would transport astronauts to the moon by the mid-2020s. NASA’s contract worth 2.89 billion US dollars left a sour taste in Jeff Bezo’s and Alabama-based defense contractor.

The USDJPY pair appreciated by a moderate 0.29% level, boosting investor confidence in other parts of the world.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2. The AUDUSD pair was up by a tiny margin of 0.05% but this didn\'t make an impact on the USD confidence levels.

In Modi’s ideal economy of India, it produces its own electronic devices and urges companies using Chinese parts to replace them with Indian parts if they wish to sell their finished electronic goods in a key market, money printing market.

The king of cryptocurrencies has fallen and investors are worried about its future. Bitcoin was flying high up in the air a month ago. Experts had predicted a new world record at $100000 but unfortunately, these predictions turned out to be quite unrealistic at the end. It is true that Bitcoin had been moving towards this mark but sudden changes in the market lead to a huge fall from the top.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bitcoin is right now trading in the $30000s level and is expected to crash further before making a rebound. But the question here is that wouldn’t that be too late for the Bulls?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The rise of bitcoin took it to the highest peak and now that it has fallen by more than $30000, the Bulls are in deep trouble. In a recent announcement it was revealed that thousands of small investors have gone bankrupt due to the sudden change of events. And the Bitcoin losing streak is expected to continue in June. This is good news for the bears that have been maximizing their benefits since the last few weeks but the Bulls are deep under water!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Bitcoin latest development&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Chinese step to crackdown and the increased awareness about the environment has pushed down BTC to its lowest this month. If we look at the bigger picture, Bitcoin has declined by a huge margin of 40% in value and this gap is expected to widen even more in June. The expected fall is predicted to touch the 50% mark and that is what is troubling investors right now.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bitcoin losses increased by 8.2% today and it is now trading at $35339. The king of crypto has been smashed to the ground with no escape in sight. The previous periods losses accumulated to 6.2% which shows how consistently it has been falling with every passing day.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ulrik Lykke, executive director of ARK36 explained this movement in the following words:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“Bitcoin is currently in a bit of ‘slumber mode’ trading in the range of $34000 and $40000”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ulrik’s statement shows an optimistic view that predicts a comeback for the King. This may be true in future but for now the BTC seems to be stuck in the bear’s den. If we look at the facts, Bitcoin has already lost 37% value in the month of May. If these losses continue to increase, Bitcoin will be at the lowest point since September 2011.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Why is Bitcoin falling?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bitcoin was rising to a point which would’ve made it unbeatable in the crypto world. Unfortunately, the timing of this rise was not ideal. China recently announced a crackdown against anyone who was involved in Bitcoin mining. Their reasons were quite clear; waste of resources was not an option for them. While this had damaging the position of Bitcoin already, Tesla founder, Elon Musk announced that they were no longer going to be accepting payments in Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The two announcements from the two different parts of the world proved to be damaging for Bitcoin. Investors lost confidence and the rest is history. Bitcoin came crashing down to the point which was not expected at all.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The King of crypto is expected to rise later again in July but till then, the Bears are in complete control.

Not only growing but the it has been speeded up since February.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now you must be thinking what could be causing this trend?

Their main game is revolving around the number of subscribers.

This alone is a huge yes yes for you to trade right here. Know that it has a current secure BEV market of 16% and that is certainly amazing potential.
